# CV Latex
Producing my curriculum vitae using Latex through VScode or Overleaf  (uses the template repository [VScode for Latex](https://github.com/nicolosh/VScode_for_Latex))  
Remember to press `Ctrl+Shift+P` when you modify some other files other than `resume.tex`;  
after that press `Ctrl+S` to see the changes of the `resume.pdf` file.
